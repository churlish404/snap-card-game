# SNAP!

## Introduction
A 2-player game of snap written in Java.

## Instructions
Each player enters their player name. 
Each player then takes turns to click enter
to draw a card from the deck. If a card of the same rank as the previous card
is drawn on a players turn then that player wins.
If no snaps are made and all cards are drawn then the game
ends as a draw.

## Future Features
Adding a timer so that upon a snap occuring the current player has 2 seconds to type "SNAP";
Adding functionality whereby players win hands and get cards that have been thrown into the pot
the winner is then the player with most cards after so many hands
